          known for its remarkable resilience. The connection here is that Rust
          was made with one goal in mind: <i>Ensure memory safety</i>. Story

            forcing him to take the stairs 21 stories up.

          He then decided to create Rust, focusing on making it a memory-safe

            Alright, so, for starts I should mention Rust is a compiled
            low-level programming language, with high level abstractions. This
            basically means we've got a very fast compiled program that somewhat
            easily written. Rust also achieves its memory safety by essentialy
            preventing that the programmer writes memory unsafe code.

              installing Rust and its package manager cargo
            </a>
            , you can run this command the create a new Rust project called
            hello_world:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-shell">~$ cargo new hello_world</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This will create a <code>hello_world/</code> directory with the{" "}
            <code>src/main.rs</code> file that will contain the main function of
            your code, and also a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file that will contain
            program data like its name and dependencies. Your file tree should
            look something like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>{fileTree}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Perfect! Now open up the <code>src/main.rs</code>, it should contain
            a simple hello world program, let's understand it!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Hello World! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
          <p>A hello world program in Rust is structured like this:</p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-rust">{rustHelloWorld}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Where:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>fn main()</code> is defining a new function called main.
              </li>
              <li>
                and <code>println!()</code> is a <strong>macro</strong> that
                writes to the standard output.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Cool! Let's now break it down. Firstly, the program creates a
            function called main, the body of this function (simmilarly to
            something like C++) is where Rust will first execute your code!
            Inside the body of this function there is a <i>macro</i>{" "}
            <code>println!()</code> being executed.{" "}
          </p>
          <Dropdown dropDownText="Now, what is a macro?">
            <p>
              According to the Rust docs:{" "}
              <i>
                <a
                  href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#:~:text=macros%20are%20a%20way%20of%20writing%20code%20that%20writes%20other%20code"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >
                  "macros are a way of writing code that writes other code".{" "}
                </a>
              </i>
              Essentialy, macros allow functions to have a variable number of
              arguments,{" "}
              <i>
                since when compiling they expand to a case matched in the
                macros' definition.
              </i>
              In the hello world example, <code>println!()</code> is a macro
              because it can more arguments, like, if you were printing a
              variable:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code className="language-rust">{rustVariablePrint}</code>
